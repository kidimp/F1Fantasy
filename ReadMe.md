###### **Create up to 3 teams**
Each team consists of 5 drivers and 2 constructors. Stay within the cost cap of $100m. Give your team a name.

###### **DRS Boost**
Choose which driver will score double points.
Pick one driver in your team to receive the DRS Boost. Any driver in your team can receive the DRS Boost which will double their score for that Grand Prix.

###### **Chips**
F1 Teams constantly bring upgrades for their cars and chips can help power-up your team too.
Each chip will suit different situations throughout the season. Whether it’s helping you to make wholesale changes to your line-up or giving one driver a huge x3 score multiplier there’s a chip that can help. Once you’ve chosen to use one of your chips that decision is final and cannot be cancelled.
There are six chips available but each one can only be used once during the season and you can only use one per race, so choose carefully.
There are 6 chips available in total and you can choose from 3 of these straightaway - these are Autopilot, Extra DRS Boost and No Negative. The remaining 3 will unlock for your team’s 2nd race. Each chip can only be used once during the season and you can only use one per race, so choose carefully.
What is the Autopilot chip?
Autopilot will change the DRS Boost selection and give it to the highest scoring driver in your team, if that turns out to be different to your original choice.

**What is the Extra DRS Boost chip?**
Play this chip to choose one driver to get a huge 3x multiplier on their score for the next Grand Prix weekend. You can select any driver in your team but if your choice already has the regular 2x DRS Boost you’ll have to give that to another driver.

**What is the No Negative chip?**
Thinking of going for a risky strategy this week? Use the No Negative chip and if any of your team members score a negative you will limit your loss at zero points for that driver or constructor. New for this year, No Negative is applied per scoring category, not just the overall total for the driver or constructor. You will still be deducted points for making more than the permitted number of free transfers.

**What is the Wildcard chip?**
The Wildcard chip let’s you make an unlimited number of changes to your team – staying within the cost cap, of course. The chip will remain active until the next team-lock deadline so you can come back and tinker with your line-up throughout. The Wildcard chip is not available for your first race because there is already no limit to the transfers at that can be made. This chip is available after your team has completed one whole race weekend.

**What is the Limitless chip?**
Limitless is like a turbocharged Wildcard. Play this chip and not only do you get unlimited transfers, you also have no cost cap for this race! Splash the cash a pick all the top drivers and teams for the next race and forget about the price tag. Your original team will be restored after the race. This chip is available after your team has completed one whole race weekend. All transfers done in the raceweek where the limitless chip is applied are counted as unlimited transfers under the limitless chip and no free transfers shall be carried into the next race week.

**What is the Final Fix chip?**
Use the Final Fix chip and make a single change to your team between the end of Qualifying and the start of the Grand Prix. You will not incur a penalty if you’ve already used all of your free transfers. You will keep the points already earned by the driver you remove from your team and only score points for the incoming selection from the next track session (Sprint or Race) onwards. This chip is available after your team has completed one whole race weekend. You cannot change the DRS Boost allocation when playing your final fix chip, if the driver you remove has DRS Boost applied then the incoming driver will receive the 2x score for the next session. Your original team selection will be restored following the Race, with your Final Fix driver removed from the line-up.

###### **Transfers**
Fine-tune your lineup for each race with transfers.
You have 2 free transfers ahead of every race for each team that you manage. If you make more than the 2 transfers, each additional transfer will incur a 10 point penalty for your team.
1 unused free transfer will carry over to the next race.

###### **Leagues**
Join or create a public or private league and invite your friends to join. In the league settings there’s a link so you can easily share the access code via email or social media.
We’ve made it easier to see who’s winning your league by adding the player’s name to the tables.

\* Positions gained/lost are calculated based on the starting and finishing position of the driver in the race and not they’re qualifying result. Unclassified drivers will not have any positions lost calculated, instead they will receive the -20point penalty. Cars starting from the pitlane will be considered to have started from a position relative to the last car on the grid.

\*\* Overtakes are considered valid when one driver legally passes another on track, and the driver passed was not entering or in the pit lane or suffering a car failure or going unreasonably slow.

\*\*\* Driver Of The Day is the result of the official F1® Driver Of The Day award.

\*\*\*\* Disqualified drivers will receive a penalty and they will not be awarded any points from the session, including Driver Of The Day. Pitstops completed by drivers who are later disqualified will not be included when Constructor points are calculated.
